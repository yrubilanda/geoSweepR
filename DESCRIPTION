Description: This package provides tools to generate spatial heatmaps from point-based geospatial data using kernel density estimation and kriging. 
            Supports features like filtering by category, resampling for small datasets, customizing coordinate reference systems (CRS), and overlaying optional basemap.
            Includes a sample dataset (`dc_sample.csv`) for demonstration purposes, accessible via `system.file()`.
